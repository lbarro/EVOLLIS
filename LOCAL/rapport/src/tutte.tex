\section{Tutte's algorithm}

The basic graph theory terminology defined in the article ~\cite{pa, pb}
will be used.  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a planar graph. A mapping $\Gamma$ of $G$
into the plane is a function $\Gamma : V \cup E \to P(\mathbb{R}^2)$. This
function maps a vertex $v \in V$ to a point in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and an edge
$e = uv \in E$ to the straight line segment joining $\Gamma(u)$ and
$\Gamma(v)$.  A mapping is an embedding if distinct vertices are mapped to
distinct points and the open segment of each edge does not intersect any
other open segment of an edge or a vertex.
\\

A way to build embeddings of any planar, 3-connected graph $G=~(V,E)$ have
been produced by Tutte in 1963 ~\cite{pc}. Let $C$ be a cycle of
vertices. Those vertices are the vertices of a face of G in some (not
necessarily straight-line) embedding of $G$. Let $\Gamma$ be a mapping of
$G$ into the plane.

% In 1963, Tutte~\cite{pc} gave a way to build embeddings of any planar,
% 3-connected graph $G=~(V,E)$. Let $C$ be a cycle whose vertices are the
% vertices of a face of G in some (not necessarily straight-line) embedding
% of $G$. Let $\Gamma$ be a mapping of $G$ into the plane, satisfying the
% conditions:

% \begin{itemize}

% \item the set Ve of the vertices of the cycle C is mapped to the vertices of a strictly
% convex polygon Q, in such a way that the order of the points is respected;

% \item each vertex in $V_i = V \ V_e$ is a barycenter with positive coefficients of
% its adjacent vertices (Tutte assumed all coefficients to be equal to 1, but
% the proof extends without changes to this case). In other words, the images
% v of the vertices v under $\Gamma$ are obtained by solving a linear system
% (S): for each $u \in V_{i, v|uv \in E} \lambda_{uv} (u - v) = 0$, where the
% $\lambda_{uv}$ are positive reals. It can be shown that the system (S) admits
% a unique solution.

% \end{itemize}

\begin{theo} \label{theo:box} (Tutte’s Theorem) Let $Ve$ be a set of the
  vertices of the cycle $C$ mapped to the vertices of a strictly convex
  polygon $Q$, in such a way hat the order of the points is respected.  If
  for each vertex in $V_i = V \ V_e$ is a barycenter with positive
  coefficients of its adjacent vertices (Tutte assumed all coefficients to
  be equal to 1, but the proof extends without changes to this case), so
  $\Gamma$ is an embedding of $G$ into the plane, with strictly convex
  interior faces.
